CurreChat has been developed especially for teaching purposes. For more general use it's recommended to use the the university licensed generative AI service [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://helpdesk.it.helsinki.fi/en/help/20071). \n \n **Access to the service and use in courses** — University of Helsinki staff have access to the general user interface of the service. Students can use CurreChat in courses where the service has been activated. As a teacher, you can find your courses and activate them via the \"Courses I teach\" button. \n \n **Usage limits** — The use of advanced language models is limited to a certain number of tokens. For general use, the counter is reset monthly. In courses, students have a certain number of tokens available for the entire course. Teachers have the option to raise the token limit for their course and reset students' token counters. \n \n To reduce token consumption, reset the conversation when you change the topic. _Note that use of the lighter language models (4o-mini and 4.1-mini) does not decrease yout token counter._ \n \n **Data security and user responsibilities** — CurreChat uses large language models developed by OpenAI, which are hosted on Microsoft Azure cloud services within the EU. Materials entered into the service are not used for training language models, and conversations are not stored in the system. \n \n CurreChat complies with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). _However, confidential or secret information must not be processed in CurreChat._ The user must ensure that they have sufficient rights to process the materials they enter into the service. \n \n **Instructions and further information** \n \n - [Artificial intelligence in teaching](https://teaching.helsinki.fi/instructions/node/3923) (Instructions for teaching) \n - [Using AI to support learning](https://studies.helsinki.fi/instructions/node/3968) (The Studies Service) \n - [Generative AI at the university](https://helpdesk.it.helsinki.fi/en/help/20064) (IT HelpDesk) \n - [General principles for the use of generative artificial intelligence](https://flamma.helsinki.fi/s/4GSqe) (Flamma) \n - For questions about CurreChat, you can contact [educationaltechnology@helsinki.fi](mailto:educationaltechnology@helsinki.fi)"
