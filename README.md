# CurreChat

LLM chat built for University of Helsinki staff and students, for education and research.

Some key features include:

- Access based on enrolments and staff role
- Custom system prompts managed by teachers
- Retrieval-augmented generation: teachers can bring their own source material for a course

## Development

Quickstart:

- Install npm, docker and docker compose
- Clone the repository
- Copy `.env.template` as `.env` file and fill in the required values
- Run `npm i` and `npm start` to setup and start the development environment

## Environment setup

See `compose.yaml` for local development. In short, in addition to the CC server, you need

- PostgreSQL (docker)
- Redis (docker)
- Ollama (docker)
- Azure
- S3

### Azure

Azure is used for OpenAI LLMs.

Create an AI foundry resource (or something) and create deployment for the models you want to use (gpt4.1 for example).

Then populate .env with the following:
```
AZURE_RESOURCE=<name-of-the-resource-you-created>
AZURE_API_KEY=<asd>
GPT_41=<name-of-the-deployment-you-created>
```

### S3

S3 is used for storing user-uploaded files and their processed versions.

Create an S3 bucket and populate .env with the following:
```
S3_HOST=<host-url>
S3_BUCKET=<name-of-the-bucket-you-created>
S3_ACCESS_KEY=<access-key>
S3_SECRET_KEY=<secret-key>
```

## Developers: things to know

### Debugging in production

In browser console, run
```
toggleDevtools()
```

### Common issues

Getting `Error: Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-linux-arm64-musl` on MacOS?
This is likely because you ran `npm i` locally.
Try removing package-lock.json locally and running
```
docker compose build
```

If then you're getting `concurrently not found`, prepend the `npm run dev` script with `npm i` and run once with that.

## E2E Testing

Playwright e2e tests are located in `e2e`. `playwright.config.ts` is also important.

Run the tests with
```bash
npm run e2e
```

To run just one test, mark it with `.only`:

```ts
test.only('test name', async ({ page }) => {
  // test code
});
```

When writing new spec file, make sure to import the test function from the fixtures file, like this:
```ts
import { teacherTest as test } from './fixtures'
```

So that the global foreach function runs for your tests. For different user roles (`studentTest`, `teacherTest`, `adminTest`), import the corresponding test function:
```ts
import { studentTest as test } from './fixtures'
```

### Test setup and data

Test user headers are defined in `src/shared/testData.ts`. TEST_COURSES are also defined there.

Before each test, the test data of a test user is reset by calling the `/test/reset-test-data` endpoint. It is found at `src/server/routes/testUtils.ts`.

When running the tests, the headers `x-test-user-idx` and `x-test-user-role` are set, defining the test user's id and iam-based role. They are read at `src/server/middleware/user.ts`.

The tests are isolated so that each (should at least) modifies their own data discriminated by the user's id. This allows parallel execution.

## Trivia

The terms `course` and `chatInstance` refer to the same thing in the codebase. However, only `chatInstance` is correct, always prefer it.
